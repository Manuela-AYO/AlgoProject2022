If you want to begin a algo project. Go in the specific folder [type]/algo/[AlgoName]

In this folder, you can do whatever you want, structure is not fixe. You can import some data for your test... ect

At the end, it must contain at least of global file (use a relevent name). This file should have a header :

'''
Description: 

Author: 
Date: 
Usage: 
Input: if there is
Output: 
References: if there is
'''


Your file should contain one global Class or Function that can be call from outside

And also, a way to execute the file locally with this lines of code :

if __name__ == "__main__":
	call my global function/Class
