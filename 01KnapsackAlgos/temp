This folder would contain the 01Knapsack class.

Guys, need your point of view : I think as we're using python which is a Object-oriented language, we could use its benefits which are for example classes. 
We could have a 01Knapsack class which methods would be all the functions we're going to program + another method to generate an output file from the reults
of a knapsack algorithm.

And this class oriented object would also be great for portability. Means if we also implement for example multidimensional knapsack problem, it would also 
be a class.

To conclude, we could all implement our different functions and then pack them in a class when they individually work.
