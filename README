From the home directory of the project,
To execute an algorithm : 
    cd TestingModule
    python3 01Knapsack.py OutputFileName AlgoName TypeFile InstanceName MTheoricalValue MTime MIteration
        where OutputFileName : Name of the File in which the result will be written(It will use a csv format)
              AlgoName : the name of the algorithm we want to run
              TypeFile : type of the instance file - t : for txt and c for csv
              InstanceName : file containing the instance of the knapsack problem
              MTheoreticalValue : optimal value of the problem. It is '-' if the theoretical value is unknown
              MTime : the time in milliseconds to run the algorithm. '-' if we don't want to specify the time
              MIteration : the number of iterations. This one is for algorithms that use iterations : 
              randomized and ant colony. '-' if an algorithm doesn't need it

              For genetic algorithm, the extra parameter is the number of individuals that we specify
              by adding to the command line above :
                --sp1 number_individuals
              This value is an integer one.

              For randomized algorithm : 
                We need an extra parameter called the selection ratio. To specify it, we add to the command line : --sp1 selection_ratio
                Its value is between 0.1 and 0.5
              
              For ant colony : 
                We need two extra parameters : 
                    - the number of ants : any integer value
                    - the decay : [0,1]
                To specify them, we add to the command line : --sp1 number_ants --sp2 decay

    Note : OutputFileName will be stored in the folder 01Knapsack/Output
           InputName should be located in 01Knapsack/Input

To create an instance of the 0/1 knapsack problem :
    cd 01Knapsack/Generators
    python3 01_ks_1_gen.py nb_items knapsack_weight range distribution
        where nb_items : total number of items
              knapsack_weight : maximum capacity of the sack
              range : maximum weight that an item can have. [1, knapsack_weight - knapsack_weight/4]
              distribution : in {1,2,3} with 
                - 1 : no correlation between weights and values
                - 2 : weak correlation between weights and values
                - 3 : strong correlation between weights and values
