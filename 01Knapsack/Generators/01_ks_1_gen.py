"""
    This module performs the creation of an instance of the knapsack problem.
    This one is set by the user who defines :
        * the distribution he/she wants to have for items 
            - 1 : uncorrelated data, means weights and profits are randomly created
            - 2 : weakly correlated data, means profits depend on weights + small noise
            - 3 : strongly correlated data, means profits totally depend on weights
            - 4 : inverse strongly correlated data, means weights depend on profits
            - 5 : almost strongly correlated data, means profits depend on data +/- noise
            - 6 : subset sum instance, means profits are equal to weights
            - 7 : uncorrelated data with similar weights, profits and data are randomly chose from another range
            - 8 : multiple strongly correlated data, means profits totally depend on weights + additional information
            - 9 : ceiling data, there profits are multiples of a given parameter
            - 10 : circle data, means profits form a circle
            - 11, 12, 13 : spanner data. These instances are constructed such that all items are multiples
                    of a quite small set of itemsâ€”the so-called spanner set
                    
        * the possibility to define or not the capacity of the knapsack
        
        * the range of the items
